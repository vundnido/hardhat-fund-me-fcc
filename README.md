# FundMe Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates the ability to send and withdraw funds to/from a smart contract. It comes with a FundMe contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat clean
```
